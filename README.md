# My First AI Coding Agent 🤖

> AI-powered development workflow that converts specifications into production code through supervised agent execution.

Built during **Agentics 101** to master specification-driven development.

## What This Demonstrates

- **Specification writing**: Converting requirements into precise instructions
- **AI supervision**: Directing Claude.ai to generate code from specs
- **Human-in-the-loop review**: Maintaining quality through verification
- **Safety protocols**: Operating AI within bounded parameters
- **Professional documentation**: Creating maintainable projects

## The Workflow

📝 Specification → 🤖 Agent Generation → 👤 Human Review → ✅ Production

1. Write detailed requirements in `specs/`
2. AI agent generates code matching specifications
3. Human verifies output quality and accuracy
4. Approved code committed and deployed

## Results

- **Development Time**: 15 minutes spec-to-code (vs ~2 hours manual)
- **First-Pass Accuracy**: 95%+ with detailed specifications
- **Iterations**: 2-3 cycles to production quality
- **Efficiency Gain**: ~8x faster than traditional coding

**Key Learning**: Specification detail directly correlates with output quality.

## Technical Stack

**Development Tools**
- AI Agent: Claude.ai (Sonnet 4)
- Version Control: GitHub
- Deployment: GitHub Pages

**Approach**
- Methodology: Specification-driven development
- Human Role: Supervisor, reviewer, quality control
- Agent Role: Code generation, implementation
- Safety Model: Human-in-the-loop (HITL)

## Project Structure

my-first-agent/ ├── specs/ # 📋 Specifications (read-only for agent) ├── src/ # 📦 Generated code (deployed) ├── SAFETY.md # 🛡️ Safety protocols └── README.md # 📖 Documentation

## How to Use

1. **Write Specification** in `specs/` with colors, measurements, behaviors
2. **Generate Code** using Claude.ai with system prompt
3. **Review Output** for accuracy and quality
4. **Deploy** to `src/` and commit changes

## Key Learnings

- Precise specifications eliminate AI ambiguity
- Directive feedback beats vague requests
- Manual review builds error-detection intuition
- Safety protocols prevent disasters

## Safety Features

✅ Human approval required for all changes  
✅ Agent scope bounded to specific folders  
✅ Full Git history for rollback capability  
✅ Documented procedures in SAFETY.md
